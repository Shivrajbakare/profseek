He will rant/yell at anyone who tries to disturb his ego. He will give you assignments but won't evaluate them so that you can't know your mistakes and set exams from those assignments and then he will do binary marking stating everything was from assignment. I failed in midsem and dropped the course midway because of this foul play which I was subjected to. He also suffers from shortage of memory problem that he has a knack of forgetting ultra important things. like he forgot to take a quiz! He forgets to attach questions with assignments. He protects his study material which he has copied from some books like it's some Kohinoor. His lectures are very monotonous as he lacks energy and clarity in his speech. He is not so articulate in expressing what he is thinking. He is a sadist who enjoys failing students and blaming them for his own mistakes and lacuna. He is a typical old age Bengali hardcore professor. Beware of him.",1,Teaching,true,ME630,-,even 2024-25,0

The way she teaches is that we’re given a reading before class, and then the class itself is just an open discussion and analysis of that reading. Both times, the class size was really small (less than 10 people), so it was easy to speak up and have a discussion. There were assignments given every week, but we only had to submit a fixed number of those. And alongside that, we worked on a term paper throughout the semester on a topic of our choosing. There were no exams. The texts were a bit challenging to understand at times, but ma’am always encouraged us to come see her if anything was unclear after class. I learned a lot from both courses. They were structured really well, and ma’am is clearly very knowledgeable about the subjects. Plus, she’s great at teaching it. I’d definitely recommend her courses to anyone interested in these topics.",5,Teaching,true,ENG743,B,odd 2024-25,0

Must interact  after the class to get to know more about history or whatever. Grades well. One word type Examination. Level of exam increases as course proceeds. He is strict but if you listen him carefully then you can get best knowledge and gradually you will develop an interest. Gives extra points to regular ones.
